# Admin

This repository contains the admin interface for a full-stack web application developed using Angular for the front end and Node.js for the backend. The admin interface provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the backend operations and administrative tasks of the web application.

Key Features:

User Management: Administrators can manage user accounts, including creating new accounts, updating user profiles, and managing user roles and permissions.

Content Management: Admins have the ability to manage content within the application, including adding, editing, and deleting products/services, managing categories, and updating site content.

Dashboard: The admin interface includes a dashboard with key metrics and analytics to provide insights into user activity, sales performance, and other relevant data.

Access Control: Administrators can configure access control settings, including defining roles and permissions for different user groups, ensuring secure access to sensitive features and data.

Technologies Used:

Angular: The admin interface is built using Angular, a powerful front-end framework for building dynamic and responsive single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a modular architecture and component-based development approach, facilitating the creation of intuitive and interactive user interfaces.

Node.js: The backend services for the admin interface are developed using Node.js, leveraging its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations for scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs.

Bootstrap: The admin interface utilizes Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, for responsive design and layout components, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices and screen sizes.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
