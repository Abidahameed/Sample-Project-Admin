# Sample-Project-Admin
This project is a full-stack web application built using Angular for the front end and Node.js for the backend. It encompasses both user and admin sides, providing distinct interfaces and functionalities tailored to different roles within the application.

This repository contains the admin interface for a full-stack web application developed using Angular for the front end and Node.js for the backend. The admin interface provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the backend operations and administrative tasks of the web application.

Key Features:

User Management: Administrators can manage user accounts, including creating new accounts, updating user profiles, and managing user roles and permissions.

Content Management: Admins have the ability to manage content within the application, including adding, editing, and deleting products/services, managing categories, and updating site content.

Dashboard: The admin interface includes a dashboard with key metrics and analytics to provide insights into user activity, sales performance, and other relevant data.

Access Control: Administrators can configure access control settings, including defining roles and permissions for different user groups, ensuring secure access to sensitive features and data.

Technologies Used:

Angular: The admin interface is built using Angular, a powerful front-end framework for building dynamic and responsive single-page applications (SPAs). Angular provides a modular architecture and component-based development approach, facilitating the creation of intuitive and interactive user interfaces.

Node.js: The backend services for the admin interface are developed using Node.js, leveraging its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations for scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend through RESTful APIs.

Bootstrap: The admin interface utilizes Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, for responsive design and layout components, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices and screen sizes.
